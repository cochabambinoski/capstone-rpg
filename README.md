## Development, desing and logic
### The idea
This game has been designed as a tribute to a friend of mine, so that is why is set in the City at night. 
He loved to party and he always been a good person, trying to help other people and protect them from bad guys.

### Planning

- First 2 days: I had no idea how to proceed here because I didn't know anything about Phaser or developing games,
so I investigated a lot and followed many guides, about many different games and game types. I did a few, but none of them even
close to a RPG game, that is what I was looking for.
- Third day: I was practicing according the RPG guide provided, but I felt sick so I paused the development for a while.
- Fouth day (after a 2 days break): I started developing according the guide and the logic of movement in a map, 
this part was easy, but the hardest part was thinking about what can I add to this base, so I thought in health bar and lvls as another RPGS.
- Fifth day: Also I decided to change all visualization, therefore I with the help of my sister (which is a graphic designer
with experience creating games designs), created most of the designs.
- Sixth day: Game was working, and was developed with the ES6 and webpack design, so I created the tests as fast a possible and design the API
all day long.
- Seven day: I pushed my self to fix all lintern issues, make all the project fit together, deploy the project 
and send the project to review the same day.

### Characters

- The heros are based in friends of mine.
- The enemies are based in a cultural design properly from Bolivia, what I tried here was a bare intention to show
a little of the culture in my country. The final intention was causing laughs, and hope to not disturb anyone.
